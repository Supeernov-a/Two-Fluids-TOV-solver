# Two-Fluids-TOV-solver
This noteebook contains two Python scripts:
The first one is a Python code for solving the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff(TOv) equation in its invariant form, using numerical methods.
The second notebook is a Python code for solving the generalization of TOV's equation for two fluids, in this case, baryonic matter 
is modelled by a MIT Bag model and dark matter is modeled by a Bosonic gas.
