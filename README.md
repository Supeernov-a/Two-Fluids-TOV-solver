# Two-Fluids-TOV-solver
This noteebook contains two Python scripts:

The first one, Scale Invariant form of TOV, is a Python code for solving the usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff(TOv) equation in its invariant form, using numerical methods.

The second notebook, Two-fluids Solver, is a Python code for solving the generalization of TOV's equation for two fluids, in this case, baryonic matter 
is modelled by a MIT Bag model and dark matter is modeled by a Bosonic gas.
